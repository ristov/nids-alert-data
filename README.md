NIDS Alert Group Data Set
=========================


Introduction
------------
This repository contains a NIDS alert group data set that covers 60 days
(January 2022 -- March 2022) and was produced with the customized version 
of the SCAS algorithm (https://github.com/ristov/nids-alert-proc). The data
set was collected on the external network perimeter of a large institution
and contains over 1.3 million data points. Each point represents a group of
one or more network IDS alerts generated for the same external IP address 
and for the same signature in a short time frame (the time frame does not 
exceed 5 minutes).

The data set has been used for machine learning experiments with the tools
from the https://github.com/ristov/nids-alert-proc repository, and is shared
for facilitating research in the field of network IDS alert classification.

Since each data point is generated by the customized version of SCAS which is 
a stream clustering algorithm, data points have labels that indicate whether
SCAS regarded the data point as an inlier or outlier. In addition, data points
have labels assigned by a human that indicate if the data point represents an
important or irrelevant alert group. Irrelevant alert groups correspond to
either threats of low importance (such as scanning for old vulnerabilities)
or false positives (such as alerts about attempts to resolve botnet C&C server 
DNS names which are actually generated by specific security applications).


Data set fields
---------------
Each data point has the following fields:

Timestamp -- alert group reporting time (seconds since Epoch)

SignatureText -- human readable alert text

SignatureID -- numerical signature ID

SignatureMatchesPerDay -- average number of matches per day by the signature

AlertCount -- the number of alerts in the current group

Proto -- numerical protocol ID (e.g., 6 denotes TCP and 17 denotes UDP)

ExtIP -- anonymized external IP address (extip<number>)

ExtPort -- port at the external host, set to -1 if alerts involved multiple 
  external ports

IntIP -- anonymized internal IP address (intip<number>), set to -1 if alerts 
  involved multiple internal IP addresses

IntPort -- port at the internal host, set to -1 if alerts involved multiple 
  internal ports

Similarity -- overall similarity with other alert groups from the same cluster
  (or with other outlier alert groups if the current alert group is an outlier)

Label -- label assigned by a human (0 denotes irrelevant and 1 important)

SCAS -- label assigned by SCAS (0 denotes inlier and 1 outlier)

<attribute>Similarity -- similarity for the attribute <attribute>, set to -1
  if the <attribute> is not set for the given signature. The field indicates
  how often has the attribute value been observed in other alert groups from 
  the same cluster (or in other outlier alert groups if the current alert 
  group is an outlier)
